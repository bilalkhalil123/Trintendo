# Test Coverage Documentation

## What is Covered Well

- **Authentication**: User registration, login, and authorization workflows
- **Restaurant Operations**: CRUD operations for restaurants, menus, and items
- **Order Processing**: Full order lifecycle from creation to completion
- **Payment Processing**: Core payment functionalities excluding third-party webhook handling
- **Customer Interactions**: Account management, preferences, and order history
- **Rider Operations**: Assignment, tracking, and delivery confirmation

## What is Not Covered and Why

- **Webhook Handlers**: Third-party payment webhook handlers (Stripe/PayPal) as they require external requests to test properly
- **Email Services**: External email delivery services that depend on third-party APIs
- **Static File Serving**: Simple Express static file middleware has minimal logic to test
- **Error Handling Middleware**: Some generic error handlers with minimal logic
- **Database Connection Code**: MongoDB connection code as it's infrastructure code rather than business logic
- **External API Integrations**: Code that relies on external services requires mocking, which is handled separately
